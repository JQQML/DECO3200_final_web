减少碳足迹

您的碳足迹可以衡量您日常活动所排放的温室气体总量。当您开车去上班，在家中运行电器或偷偷溜走去度周末时，会导致化石燃料燃烧，从而提供了为生活方式提供动力所需的能量。

减少能源

为了保护我们热爱的人和地方免受全球变暖的影响，我们需要对能源使用做出更明智的决定。我们三分之一以上的排放来自电力消耗。

回收再利用

每次从原材料制成新产品时，都会消耗大量能量。我们可以想到能源在产品开发的四个阶段中所起的作用：原材料的提取，将这些材料制造成产品，消费者使用产品以及产品处置。在大多数情况下，回收利用的能源更少，这意味着化石燃料的燃烧量减少，温室气体的排放量减少，而导致气候变化。

节约用水

水与气候变化之间的联系。
气候变化正在加速这种趋势，因为洪水，干旱和高温直接影响着人类所需的各种类型的水的供应。改变我们用水的方式将有助于增强地球的生态系统，并减少极端天气事件的风险，极端天气事件会使水变得更加难以预测，污染和稀缺。

Reduce Your Carbon Footprint

Your carbon footprint measures the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of your daily activities. When you drive to work, run the appliances in your home or sneak off for a weekend getaway, you cause the burning of fossil fuels, which provide the energy needed to power your lifestyle.

Reduce Energy

To protect the people and places we love from the impacts of global warming we need to make more conscious decisions about our energy use. More than one-third of our emissions come from our electricity consumption.

Recycle & Reuse

Every time a new product is made from raw materials, large amounts of energy are consumed. We can think of the role energy plays in the four stages of product development: extraction of raw materials, the manufacture of these materials into products, product use by consumers and product disposal. In most cases, recycling uses less energy, which translates into fewer fossil fuels burned and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.

Save Water

The link between water and climate change.
This trend is being accelerated by climate change because floods, droughts and heat have a direct impact on the availability of the various types of water that humans need. Changing the way we use water will help to strengthen our planet’s ecosystem and reduce the risk of extreme weather events that make water more unpredictable, more polluted, and more scarce.
